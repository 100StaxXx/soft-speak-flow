# Terms of Service

**Last Updated: November 21, 2025**

## 1. Agreement to Terms

By accessing or using Soft Speak Flow ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you disagree with any part of these terms, you may not access the App.

## 2. Description of Service

Soft Speak Flow is a personal wellness and self-improvement application that provides:
- Daily mood tracking and check-ins
- Personal goal setting through quests and habits
- Virtual companion that evolves with your progress
- Motivational content including pep talks and quotes
- AI-powered mentor guidance and chat features
- Progress tracking and achievement system

### 2.1 AI-Powered Personalization

To provide better recommendations and a more tailored experience, the App uses artificial intelligence to learn from your usage patterns. This includes:

- **Task completion patterns**: When you complete tasks, the times you're most productive, and your success rates with different task types
- **Scheduling preferences**: How you modify AI-generated schedules and your preferred task timing
- **Interaction patterns**: How you respond to AI suggestions (accept, modify, or skip)
- **Category preferences**: Which types of activities you engage with most successfully

This behavioral learning is used **solely** to improve your personal experience within the App. Your learning profile:
- Is private to your account
- Is never shared with third parties for advertising purposes
- Can be reset at any time through your account settings
- Does not include the content of your personal entries (journals, reflections, etc.)

By using the App, you consent to this personalization. If you prefer not to have AI learn from your behavior, you may disable personalized recommendations in Settings, though this may reduce the App's ability to provide tailored suggestions.
