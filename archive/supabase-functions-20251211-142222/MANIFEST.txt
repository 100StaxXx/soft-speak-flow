Supabase Functions Archive
Created: 2025-12-11
Purpose: Backup before cleanup after Firebase migration

Contents:
- supabase/functions/ (all 69 edge functions)
- supabase/config.toml (function configuration)

Migration Status:
- All app code migrated to Firebase ✅
- 69 Supabase functions found (none referenced in app code)
- Firebase functions: 56 total, 50 referenced in app
- No Supabase client imports found in src/ directory

Verification Results:
- ✅ No references to Supabase functions in app code
- ✅ All functionality migrated to Firebase Cloud Functions
- ✅ Firebase cron jobs configured (scheduledGenerateDailyQuotes, etc.)
- ⚠️ Note: Verify cron jobs in Supabase database are disabled
- ⚠️ Note: Verify Apple webhook points to Firebase

This archive can be deleted after:
1. Verifying no active cron jobs in Supabase database
2. Verifying webhooks point to Firebase
3. Confirming Firebase cron jobs are active and working
4. Testing all functionality works with Firebase only
